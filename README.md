# Tasacora
Tasacora will allow you to match a data file to a blank vector (SVG) map and produce an output map displaying the provided data.

## Data sources 
Tasacora is able to parse CSV files.

## Source maps
We intend Tasacora to be compatible with maps from Open Street Map and WikiAtlas, plus the ability to upload your own SVG blank map.

# tasacora-experimental
Experimental code for Tasacora, pending architecture and division into components repositories
