# This file lists character strings usually used in SVGs to
# identify drawing elements that are not administrative subdivision
# and can therefore be ignored.
#
# These are prefixes: in an actual SVG file, a typical occurrence of
# an ID would be "clipPath3833". IDs prefixed by elements of the 
# present file will be ignored.
